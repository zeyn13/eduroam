   <p>
    In order to check if you have the possibility to use eduroam, please contact
    your home institution.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you are a student or a professor then you can also send an individual
    request

   <h4 class="for-providers-title" id="compatibleDevices">
    Compatible devices
   </h4>
   <p>
    eduroam is based on IT industry standards and there are too many devices
    which support eduroam for them to be exhaustively listed here. As a general
    rule, you can verify whether your device can do eduroam by looking into your
    device’s manual. Check for the following points
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>Does the device support wireless encryption with WPA2/AES?</li>
    <li>
     Does the device support “Enterprise” authentication (this is sometimes also
     called “IEEE 802.1X support”)?
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    If both are a “Yes”, then your device is good to go in principle. There is
    one further question which is depending on your institution’s eduroam setup
    though: Enterprise authentication happens via so-called “EAP Methods”. Your
    institution has selected one or more of these EAP methods for eduroam; and
    their list must match your device’s capabilities. Your institution will be
    able to tell you which EAP methods they support. To give you an idea what to
    look for, here is a list of popular EAP methods:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>EAP TTLS-PAP</li>
    <li>PEAP</li>
    <li>EAP TLS</li>
    <li>EAP-pwd</li>
   </ul>

    Further to these generic instructions, we have an ongoing community effort
    to document known-working devices on the following page: Compatible Devices.

   <h4 class="for-providers-title" id="geteduroam">eduroam Apps</h4>

    eduroam provides several apps through the Google and Apple app stores to
    make the use of eduroam more convenient.

     them on the map (default), get directions to the nearest eduroam access
     point or share the information to other apps.

   <h4 class="for-providers-title">Configuring your device for eduroam</h4>
   <p>
    As a golden rule, you need to configure your device only exactly once, as
    instructed to by your home institution. From then on, you can use all
    eduroam hotspots worldwide without reconfiguring anything.
   </p>
   <p>
    We recommend <a href="" id="#geteduroam">using eduraom apps</a>. However,
    you can configure manualy.Exactly how to configure your laptop or other
    handheld device for eduroam will depend on
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>which device(s) you are using and</li>
    <li>your institution’s local identity management configuration</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    If you know that your school / university / college does provide eduroam,
    <b
     >please ask the IT staff for support with setting it up on your laptop or
     other devices</b
    >. If your institution participates in our support tool “eduroam
    Configuration Assistant Tool” (eduroam CAT) then you can immediately
    download custom-made installers for your institution for many devices. To
    find out if that is the case, just hop over to https://cat.eduroam.org and
    try to find your institution in the list of providers.
   </p>
   <p>
    Important: all configuration instructions are specific for the issuing
    institution. It is not helpful to follow configuration instructions of other
    institutions; the settings are different from institution to institution and
    you will very likely mis-configure your device if trying third-party
    configurations.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you are not sure whether or not your institution provides eduroam at all,
    the National Roaming Operator for your country may be able to help with your
    enquiry.
   </p>
   <p class="for-providers-last-p">

   <h4 class="for-providers-title">eduroam network characteristics</h4>
   <p>
    eduroam networks are provided by participating institutions locally and is
    their own responsibility. As a roaming consortium, eduroam defines minimal
    compliance rules on how hotspot deployments need to act like; you can think
    of this as a “franchise” system.
   </p>
   <p>
    As a result, not all eduroam hotspots are identical. You can expect the
    following baseline configuration at eduroam hotspots:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>Use is free of charge.</li>
    <li>The wireless network is encrypted with WPA2/AES.</li>
    <li>
     Your username and password is exclusively validated with IEEE 802.1X as
     described above.
    </li>
    <li>The network gives you access to the general internet.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    In Europe, a minimum number of services (“ports”) must be made available at
    the hotspot. The list includes sending and receiving email (encrpytedly and
    unencryptedly), browsing web pages (encrpytedly and unencryptedly), and
    access to a wide variety of Virtual Private Networking (VPN) solutions which
    can connect you back to your home institution in privacy. The full list of
    ports is available in section 6.3.3 “Specifications and Operational
    Requirements: Service Providers” (p.31+) of the European eduroam Service
    Definition.
   </p>
   <p>
    Apart from that, you should consider every eduroam network as a “normal ISP”
    network. In particular, the WPA2/AES encryption only protects your traffic
    while it is in the air; as soon as it travels onwards onto the internet,
    your traffic is not encrypted any more unless you chose to use encrypted
    transfer protocols (e.g. browse with https:// instead of http:// ; or if you
    started a VPN connection).
   </p>
   <p>
    If you do not choose to encrypt your traffic on your device, everybody on
    the internet may be able to see the content of your communication in
    clear-text; record it or create profiles from it. This is not
    eduroam-specific; it’s the way the internet works.
   </p>
   <p>
    eduroam Service Providers are discouraged from inspecting traffic of their
    users; they should rather act as a “mere conduit” provider. It is however
    possible that some eduroam Service Providers choose to inspect or filter
    traffic (by using transparent web proxies).
   </p>

   <h4 class="for-providers-title">eduroam hotspots world-wide</h4>

    eduroam is a world-wide effort. Currently, eduroam Points of Presence are
    located on five continents.
